This is one of my first python projects I finished.
It is sort of a game. You need to enter some input and the program will print/output short story.
First input is our character in story.
Second input is something that character is going to find.
Third input is how will he react to it.
I said my sister to give it input without telling her what will witch input do and it was kinda funny.
I used python 3.8.5 to code this. :)
